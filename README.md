# Final Project VCPU

This repository contains the implementation of **Final Project VCPU**, a basic **8-bit RISC processor**. The processor is designed with a simple instruction set and is intentionally **not Turing complete** and does **not support recursion**. The project includes a custom assembly language for writing programs that can run on this processor.

## Features

- **8-bit RISC Architecture**: A minimal processor that executes operations using a reduced instruction set.
- **Custom Assembly Language**: A unique assembly language that allows writing programs for the processor.
- **Example Programs**:
  - **Boot_Sector_HW**: A program that prints "Hello, World!" to the output.
  - **Boot_Sector_Arith**: An example demonstrating basic arithmetic operations like addition and subtraction.
